        Hello 
          I just wanted to test this.
              It seems like (pre) is use when you 
                 want to make a cool spacing like this. 
                   Because if you do not put pre., it will turn to be like this: 

    </pre>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Helllllllllllllo              I made a          big space and this is what happens without (pre)
    <br/> <br/> <br/>
    
    If you want to know more where it is inside the same page,<a href = "Week 5_HTML/03.SecondPage.html" target="_self"> <b>click here.</b></a>
    <br/><br/>
    However things can be more fun with a different tab  <a href = "Week 5_HTML/images/img_girl.jpg" target="_blank"><b>if you click here</b></a>
    <br/><br/>
    This looks <mark>cool</mark>.
